        <p>Each year, researchers from around the world gather at Neural 
            Information Processing Systems, an artificial-intelligence 
            conference, to discuss automated translation software, self-driving 
            cars, and abstract mathematical questions. It was odd, therefore, 
            when Michael Levin, a developmental biologist at Tufts University, 
            gave a presentation at the 2018 conference, which was held in 
            Montreal. Fifty-one, with light-green eyes and a dark beard that 
            lend him a mischievous air, Levin studies how bodies grow, heal, 
            and, in some cases, regenerate. He waited onstage while one of Facebook’s 
            A.I. researchers introduced him, to a packed exhibition hall, as a 
            specialist in “computation in the medium of living systems.”</p>
