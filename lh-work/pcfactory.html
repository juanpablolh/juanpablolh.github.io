            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p class="p-body">pcFactory has been for twenty years the main destination to buy tech devices in the 
                country, however over the years it developed a communication style focused mainly on expert users 
                leaving less experienced ones behind, this linked to an outdated visual style was undermining its 
                expansion. <br> <br>
                The main challenge was to turn the brand into the expert partner that would
                allow different generations to understand technology. For that we had to rethink his name, 
                his tone of voice and his visual identity.

        <div class="solution">
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p class="p-body">To face the main challenge, we developed a new strategic platform that would 
                support future business and communication decisions, going from being a computer store to 
                the go to technology advisory space in the country. We created a tagline that would allow 
                the brand to directly reflect this new positioning. “Technology for you”, which seeks to 
                speak to both expert and beginner audiences. <br> <br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution-continue">
            <p class="p-body" id="p-body-lg"> We designed a visual identity system that brings this idea to life, allowing them to
                be a credible and modern brand, as well as incorporating key visual tools for its digital 
                experience. For the website, we developed a research process focused on creating more 
                efficient, accessible and inclusive purchasing processes, eliminating several points of 
                uncertainty in the original process. </p>
