        <h1>Bringing the main tech retail in Chile to the digital era.</h1>
        <h2>pcFactory has been for twenty years the main destination to buy tech devices in the country, 
            however over the years it developed a communication style focused mainly on expert users leaving 
            less experienced ones behind, this linked to an outdated visual style was undermining its expansion.

            <p class="subheading">The Challenge</p>
            <p class="info-case">The main challenge was to turn the brand into the expert partner that would
                 allow different generations to understand technology. For that we had to rethink his name, 
                 his tone of voice and his visual identity.

            <p class="subheading">The Solution</p>
            <p class="info-case">
               To face the main challenge, we developed a new strategic platform that would support future business and communication decisions, going from being a computer store to the go to technology advisory space in the country. We created a tagline that would allow the brand to directly reflect this new positioning. “Technology for you”, which seeks to speak to both expert and beginner audiences. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution-two">
            <p class="info-case">We designed a visual identity system that brings this idea to life, allowing them to
                 be a credible and modern brand, as well as incorporating key visual tools for its digital experience. 
                 For the website, we developed a research process focused on creating more efficient, accessible and 
                 inclusive purchasing processes, eliminating several points of uncertainty in the original process.</p>
