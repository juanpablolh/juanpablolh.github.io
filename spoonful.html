            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p class="fs-p-300">This project was designed together with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/camila-candia-874b933b/">Camila Candia</a>. As for any new brand there was a temptation to try to fit into the visual codes 
                imposed by the category's referents, losing the possibility of communicating from its own original 
                history. Spoonful's differential was in its connection with ordinary people, with their day-to-day 
                life, without promises of perfection that rarely come true. The great challenge was to build a brand 
                and a product that would provide people with the necessary tools to meet their nutritional goals 
                in a sustainable way.
            </p>

        <div class="solution">
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p class="fs-p-300">To change the paradigm. Today we are not trying to follow a diet plan, we are 
                trying to pursue a well-balanced nutrition that promotes our general well-being. We builded a 
                brand strategy focused on the latter, aiming to democratize access to convenient and tasty meals, 
                Spoonful will do this through an inclusive, empathetic and realistic way of communicate its benefits.
                 The visual identity will be bright, vibrant and expressive and it will show that different is good and 
                 uniqueness is a value for all of us.
